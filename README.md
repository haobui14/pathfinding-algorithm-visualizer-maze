# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

A simple React + TypeScript app for exploring pathfinding in randomly generated mazes. The visualizer animates how different search strategies traverse the grid to reach a goal.

## Features
- Random maze generation with start and end points
- Step-by-step animation of pathfinding
- Refreshable maze for repeated experiments

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the provided local URL (Vite defaults to http://localhost:5173)

## Implemented Algorithms
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Usage
Use the on-screen controls to regenerate the maze or to start the BFS or DFS visualization. Cells change colour as they are visited, illustrating the order in which the algorithm explores the grid.
